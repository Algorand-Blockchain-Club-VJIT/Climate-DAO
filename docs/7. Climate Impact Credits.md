## 7.3 Credit Pricing

### 7.3.1 Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

The AI system uses a sophisticated pricing model that considers:

* **Supply and Demand:** Real-time market dynamics.
* **Quality Metrics:** Project verification level and impact certainty.
* **Urgency Factors:** Climate emergency indicators.
* **Regional Variations:** Location-specific environmental needs.
* **Temporal Factors:** Time-sensitivity of environmental impact.

### 7.3.2 Pricing Formula

$$
\text{Credit Price} = \text{Base Price} \times \text{Quality Multiplier} \times \text{Urgency Factor} \times \text{Regional Adjustment} \times \text{Temporal Adjustment}
$$

* **Base Price:** Calculated from market supply and demand.
* **Quality Multiplier:** $0.8 - 1.5$ based on verification level.
* **Urgency Factor:** $1.0 - 2.0$ based on climate emergency indicators.
* **Regional Adjustment:** $0.7 - 1.3$ based on local environmental needs.
* **Temporal Adjustment:** $0.9 - 1.2$ based on timing of impact.
